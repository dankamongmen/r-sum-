\subsection*{Objectives}
To continue researching, designing, implementing, deploying and maintaining
innovative solutions for keeping the bits flowing and cachelines humming.
To snatch order from a teeming chaos in the least code possible. To see the
fruits of my labors entrusted with the packetized dreams of millions. To feel I
owe the world each day's improvements to my source trees. To gaze back upon
sixty-hour debugging sessions, seeing past the gnashed teeth, the utter
fatigue, the too-long compiles, and \textit{know} that the problem was solved.
