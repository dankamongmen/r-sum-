\subsection*{Objectives}
To continue researching, designing, implementing, deploying and maintaining
innovative solutions for keeping the bits flowing and cachelines humming.
To snatch order from a teeming chaos in the least code possible. To see the
fruits of my labors entrusted with the packetized dreams of millions. To feel I
owe the world each day's improvements to my source trees. To gaze back upon
sixty-hour debugging sessions, seeing past the gnashed teeth, the utter
fatigue, the too-long compiles, and to know that the problem was solved.

\subsection*{Open Source}
\begin{tightitemize}
\item Authored and maintain numerous open source packages, including:
\begin{tightitemize}
\item libtorque, a multithreaded, architecture-adaptive event library
\item cubar and libcudest, NVIDIA CUDA reverse-engineering tools
\item ptracer, an instruction trace generator
\end{tightitemize}
\item Contributed accepted patches to Wireshark's core IPv4 procesing, Linux's
  Matrox driver, IPv4 stack, and hugetlb filesystem, DynamoRIO,
  strace, OpenSSL, APT-secure, iproute2, bridge-utils, and Snort.
  Maintained IBM's NGPT (Next Generation POSIX Threading) patchset.

  implementation of the TrustedSource\texttrademark reputation service.
\item Rewrote the build system for IronMail\texttrademark and related products from scratch.
  Code review, automated building, virtualized testing, and unit testing were
  instituted along the way. Converted crufty CVS repositories to shiny
  Subversion repositories and investigated distributed source control.
\item Played a leading role in interviews of new research candidates.
