\section{Inspiration}

We work in the dark. We give what we have. We do what we can.
Our doubt is our passion, and our passion is our task.
The rest is the madness of art. -Henry James, "The Middle Years"

\section{Objectives}

To continue researching, designing, implementing, deploying and maintaining
innovative solutions for keeping the bits flowing and cachelines humming.
To snatch order from a teeming chaos in the least code possible. To see the
fruits of my labors entrusted with the packetized dreams of millions. To feel I
owe the world each day's improvements to my source tree. To gaze back upon
sixty-hour debugging sessions, seeing past the gnashed teeth, the utter
fatigue, the too-long compiles, and to *know* that the problem was solved.

\section{Open Source}

* Authored and maintain numerous open source packages, including:

 * libtorque, a multithreaded, architecture-adaptive event library
 * cubar and libcudest, NVIDIA CUDA reverse-engineering tools
 * ptracer, an instruction trace generator

* Contributed accepted patches to Wireshark's core IPv4 procesing, Linux's
  Matrox driver, IPv4 stack, and hugetlb filesystem, DynamoRIO,
  strace, OpenSSL, APT-secure, iproute2, bridge-utils, and Snort.
  Maintained IBM's NGPT (Next Generation POSIX Threading) patchset.

  computing, and system architecture.

2010/05 - 2010/09: Chief Engineer, AccelerEyes LLC (Atlanta, GA)

* Led design work for the "Jacket" MatLab plugin, and AccelerEyes's core
  library of CUDA functionality.
* Implemented and analyzed GPU logical and numeric codes, including
  multidimensional convolutions, decompositions, sorting and searching. 
* Redesigned CPU-GPU memory transfer to use sharing, pinning and zero-copy.
* Reimplemented build system, autotesting, and office network from scratch.

2008/08 - 2010/05: Georgia Institute of Technology
Master of Science in Computer Science (College of Computing)

* Research project: "Epicycles, Flywheels, and (Widening) Gyres: UNIX I/O
  Slouches Toward Multicore NUMA" (2009). Explored the state of the art in
  large-scale, massively parallel servers, and how current APIs ought
  change. Results include the open "libtorque" library and a 2010 paper,
  "Portable Multithreaded Continuations for Scalable Event-Driven Programs".
* Sixteen classes, with twelve from among Systems and Information Security.
* Teaching Assistant (CS6290, "High Performance Computer Architecture").

2005/12 - 2009/11: Principal Engineer, McAfee (Alpharetta, GA)

* Impact Engineer of the Year, 2007-2008.
* Sole backend developer for the Secure Web Proxy Service, a managed Web
  security/control system.
* Worked with academia in anti-bot efforts, intimately studying and engaging
  the Storm botnet. Developed the argus panoptes distributed anti-bot
  platform, and with it battled botnets across the IPv4 address space.
* Lead developer of the IronNet(TM) appliance, making use of techniques
  including latent semantic analysis, clustering, and Markovian discrimination
  to effect what IDC calls "compliance". This included the snare ICAP server.
* Developed algorithms to detect image spam used by SecureMail(TM), and
  reputation protection systems used by the PhishRegistry(TM) service.
* Developed garuda, a CheckPoint(R) OPSEC module interfacing with the
  TrustedSource(TM) reputation service.
* Developed the hurlbat protocol testing tool, and SMTP, HTTP and ICAP modules.
* Planned and led execution of IPv6 integration into Secure Computing products.
* Developed a Knoppix(R)-based CD for competitive operations in the field.
* Collaboratively designed the architecture and protocols behind a new
  implementation of the TrustedSource(TM) reputation service.
* Rewrote the build system for IronMail(TM) and related products from scratch.
  Code review, automated building, virtualized testing, and unit testing were
  instituted along the way. Converted crufty CVS repositories to shiny
  Subversion repositories and investigated distributed source control.
* Played a leading role in interviews of new research candidates.
* PCT/US2008/051869. Detecting Image Spam. 2008-07-31.

2000/08 - 2005/12: Senior Software Engineer, Reflex Security (Atlanta, GA)

* Led research team, focused on intrusion prevention, parallelized and
  distributed intrusion detection, and multiple pattern matching. Implemented
  several techniques later published by academia. Led interviewing.
* Sole developer of code for the Reflex Interceptor (now Reflex IPS(TM) and
  Reflex MG(TM)), a Layer-2 bridging NIPS running Linux. This included:
    * tako, an IPS application statefully analyzing multiple GigE links inline
      and in real time, performing a forwarding verdict on each frame via use
      of mmap(2)ed packet sockets + custom netlink(7linux) messages,
    * geso, an SMTP proxy making use of a Kaspersky Anti-Virus backend to
      filter mail inline and in real time, designed to be trivially extended
      to other store-and-forward protocols,
    * build systems, automated testing and benchmarking tools, and backend
      platform configuration management for these applications, and
    * kernel patches to change driver mechanics, expand the netlink socket
      infrastructure, and provide an interface into mmap(2)-backed sockets.
